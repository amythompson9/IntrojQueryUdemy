    //what is jQuery
        //DOM manipulation library
        //most popular tool for javascript - fast, small, feature rich
        //useful methods like - select/manipulate/create/animate elements, add event listeners, add effects, make HTTP requests (AJAX)
    //what is a library
        //take code someone else wrote and use it in our code
    //why you would use it
        //fixes "broken" DOM API
        //brevity and clarity
        //ease of use
        //cross-browser support
        //AJAX
        //lots of people use jQuery
    //why you would not use it
        //the DOM API is no longer "broken" - querySelector did not use to exist
        //It doesn't do anything you can't do on your own
        //It's an unnecessary dependency - too heavy a tool
        //performance
        //Lots of people are moving away from jQuery
