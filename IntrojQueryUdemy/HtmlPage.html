    <!--//what is jQuery
    DOM manipulation library
    most popular tool for javascript - fast, small, feature rich
    useful methods like - select/manipulate/create/animate elements, add event listeners, add effects, make HTTP requests (AJAX)
    what is a library
    take code someone else wrote and use it in our code
    why you would use it
    fixes "broken" DOM API
    brevity and clarity
    ease of use
    cross-browser support
    AJAX
    lots of people use jQuery
    why you would not use it
    the DOM API is no longer "broken" - querySelector did not use to exist
    It doesn't do anything you can't do on your own
    It's an unnecessary dependency - too heavy a tool
    performance
    Lots of people are moving away from jQuery-->

    <h1>jQuery Demo</h1>

    <ul>
        <li>Newt</li>
        <li>Monkey</li>
        <li>Pine Marten</li>
    </ul>

    <!--objectives
    select elements with $()
    use .css to style elements-->

    <!-- Selecting with jQuery
        $("selectorGoesHere")
        Selecting with jQuery is very similar
        to querySelectorAll, in that we provide a CSS
        style selector and jQuery will return all
        matching elements-->

    <!-- We select and then manipulate
        to select all img tags
        $("img")
        
        to select all elements with class sale
        $(".sale")
        
        to select element with id "bonus
        $("#bonus")
        
        to select all a tags inside of li's
        $("li a")
        -->

    <!-- Manipulating Style
        The .css() method is jQuery's interface to styling
        $(selector)
        .css(property, value)
        
        select element with id "special" and give it a border
        $("#Special").css("border", "2px solid read");
        
        can also pass in an object with styles
        var styles = {
            backgroundColor: "pink",
            fontWeight: "bold"
        };
        
        $("#special").css(styles);
        -->

    <!-- We can style multiple elements at once
        
        select all li's and make them yellow
        $("li").css("color", "yellow");
        
        select all elements with class "big"
        and give them an orange border
        $(".big").css("border", "1 px dashed orange");-->
